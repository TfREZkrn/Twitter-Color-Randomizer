# Twitter-Color-Randomizer
it randomizes the logo color of Twitter

you need to open it and put the path to your twitter logo where it says at the botttom.
Requirements:
Python 3 (i know it works on 3.7, it should work on earlier versions of 3 though)
PIL (python imaging library)
A twitter logo (I'll include it if i remember to)
A good-ish computer or a long time (or follow the steps in comments)

I'm new to github (and self tought in python), so any advice is welcome! I also don't know how copyright works or anything like that but feel free to take and repost this directly (and credit me) or change it up and add something new (and credit me if you want thx)
