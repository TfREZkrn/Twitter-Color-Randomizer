# Twitter-Color-Randomizer
it randomizes the logo color of Twitter

you need to open it and put the path to your twitter logo where it says at the botttom.
Requirements:
Python 3 (i know it works on 3.7, it should work on earlier versions of 3 though)
PIL (python imaging library)
A twitter logo (I'll include it if i remember to)
A good computer (or follow the steps in comments)

I'm new to github
